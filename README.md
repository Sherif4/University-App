# University Management System

This repository contains the implementation of a University Management System, showcasing various aspects of software development including database design, SQL implementation, PL/SQL scripting, automation scripting, and Java application development.

## Features

- **Database Design**: Structured and normalized database schema design for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **SQL Implementation**: Creation of tables, relationships, and implementation of CRUD operations using SQL queries.
- **PL/SQL Scripting**: Implementation of stored procedures, functions, and triggers for data manipulation and validation.
- **Automation Scripting**: Bash scripts for automated backup and disk space monitoring, ensuring data integrity and system stability.
- **Java Application Development**: GUI application developed in Java using OOP and MVC principles for managing students, courses, departments, and enrollments.

## Technologies Used

- Oracle DBMS
- SQL
- PL/SQL
- Bash scripting
- Java
- JavaFX

## Project Structure

- **Database**: Contains SQL scripts for database creation, table structures, and initial data population.
- **PLSQL**: Scripts for stored procedures, functions, and triggers implemented in PL/SQL.
- **AutomationScripts**: Bash scripts for automated backup and disk space monitoring.
- **JavaApplication**: Source code for the Java application developed for managing university data.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up an Oracle database environment.
3. Run the SQL scripts in the `Database` directory to create the necessary tables and populate initial data.
4. Execute PL/SQL scripts in the `PLSQL` directory to implement stored procedures, functions, and triggers.
5. Run the Bash scripts in the `AutomationScripts` directory for automated backup and disk space monitoring.
6. Open the Java project in an IDE and run the application to manage university data.
